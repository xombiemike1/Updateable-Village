Quest Village Minecraft Datapack

Scope of work:
The goal of this datapack is to create non player characters (NPCs) for players to interact with that will send them on quests to expand a village from humble beginnings to something grand. Completing some quests will add new buildings, while other quests shall add character and history to the village. The players should feel a connection to this history as they are the ones to progress it.

One area to be unlocked shall be a harbor with a ship. The NPC ship captain can send players to a custom dimension that is all adventure mode. This area can be used for minigames that would not normally be allowed in a vanilla survival multiplayer server. It can also be used for pre-built adventure mode quests. Although player game mode will be switched when traveling to and from this dimension, inventory will remain the same, so rewards and item/equipment loss are possible. Rewards should not be excessive in the way that it will greatly affect the survival multiplayer experience. Leaderboards, trophies, experiences and story progressions are the focus.

MCStacker.net has an NPC generator that will create a template for interactions, reducing some work. CodeZelot has a datapack that can mark survival multiplayer areas as adventure mode for the village. This will prevent players from building in the village only to have their builds overwritten by quest added structures. It will also prevent the harvesting of blocks intended not to leave the village. TheMythicalSausage has a nice village download that might be used to create the needed structure blocks, but it would be preferred to use PearlescentMoonâ€™s village structures, should she grant permission.

This datapack will be public use, with the ability for the server operator to place the startup location in any world along the edge of an ocean so that the harbor will make sense.

Proof of concept:
Demo download and accompanying video shall include a walkthrough of the following;
Downloading and placing the datapack in the world save folder.
Activating the setup function and choosing a place to dedicate to the adventure mode village.
Spawning the village base point, which will create the basic village area from automated structure block commands as well as the first NPC and their quest.
Showing a player perspective of completing the first quest and seeing the resulting new structure and NPC.

Development:
Xombiemike (Mike McDaniel) Just me for now. As this is my first datapack project, I would love to bring in someone with more experience in writing command code, so let me know if you would be interested in assisting. I already have the first NPC dialogue ready with their quest complete with the exception of placing the first structure addition and second NPC.
